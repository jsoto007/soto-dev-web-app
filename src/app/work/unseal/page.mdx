## Overview

Burdier Mobile Phlebotomy was experiencing growing pains as their team scaled. Manual tasks and disjointed systems were taking a toll on their operations and slowing down their ability to serve patients effectively.

SotoDev stepped in to design and implement a custom automation system tailored to their workflow. We worked closely with the client to identify pain points and eliminate inefficiencies—without interrupting day-to-day operations.

The system has freed up over 40 hours per week for the team and enabled smoother collaboration across the organization.
