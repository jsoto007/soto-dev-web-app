## Overview

Tired of manual scheduling chaos, the ShiftMind team envisioned an AI-powered platform to automate and optimize every part of the shift management process.

With ShiftMind, admins can rotate assignments intelligently, document and conduct staff supervisions, and receive AI-driven recommendations on who should work each shift based on prior performance and strengths. The system also enables direct notifications to staff, allowing them to request available shifts that can be approved or denied by the admin with a click.

This approach has streamlined team management, improved fairness in scheduling, and provided clarity and accountability across the board.
