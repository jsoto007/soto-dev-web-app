## Overview

AutoTrack approached us to help build an intelligent vehicle tracking system designed for dealerships and used car businesses. The goal was to streamline the inventory process, assign accountability to users, and reduce errors in tracking.

We built a full-stack platform that allows staff to upload vehicles, assign daily inventory checks, and notify the admin automatically if any vehicles are unaccounted for. Admins can also sync new listings directly to major car selling apps, expanding visibility instantly.

To make it smarter, AutoTrack uses AI to generate insights, highlight trends, and recommend vehicle listing descriptions that help cars sell faster.
