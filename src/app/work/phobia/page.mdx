## Overview

MyFinanceAI began as a personal frustration with traditional budgeting tools. To solve this, I set out to create a smarter, smoother financial tracking app—one powered by AI, and designed for everyday users who want clarity and control over their money.

The platform features intelligent expense tracking, receipt scanning using Hugging Face models, personalized budgeting recommendations, and even gamified challenges to keep savings engaging.

Built solo using Python Flask on the backend, this project represents a modern approach to finance: personal, data-driven, and delightfully simple.
